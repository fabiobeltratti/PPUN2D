# **PPUN2D** ‚Äì Post-Processing Tool for Unstructured 2D CFD Solutions

**PPUN2D** (*Post-Processing Unstructured 2D Data*) is a C++ software developed for the aerodynamic force computation and drag decomposition from CFD solutions on **unstructured 2D grids**. It supports both **near-field** and **far-field** approaches and includes Green-Gauss gradient reconstruction and domain decomposition techniques. The software is intended for academic and research purposes.

> Developed at the *Italian Aerospace Research Centre (CIRA)*, in collaboration with the *University of Naples Federico II* as part of a master's thesis project.

## üöÄ Overview

PPUN2D processes binary **Tecplot (`.szplt`) files** obtained from CFD solvers and provides:

- Total aerodynamic force evaluation using the near-field approach.
- Support for **Lamb vector-based** and **thermodynamic** far-field methods.
- Drag breakdown into viscous, wave, and spurious components.
- Gradient and divergence computation via **Green-Gauss** techniques.
- Sensor-based **region tagging** (boundary layer, shock, wake).

Results are exported in both **Tecplot** and **plain-text** formats for visualization and further analysis.

## üì¶ Input Requirements

- **Tecplot `.szplt` file** containing:
  - Primitive variables: `œÅ`, `u`, `v`, `p`, `T`.
  - Optional turbulence fields: `Œº_t`, `œâ`.
  - Mesh connectivity and coordinates.

- **Configuration file** (`ppun2d_config.cas`) with:
  - Freestream conditions (Mach, Temperature, Density, etc.).
  - Flags for method activation.
  - Control volume specifications.
  - Sensor thresholds and surface definition parameters.

## üßÆ Implemented Methods

### Near-field method
Computes the aerodynamic force through surface integration of pressure and viscous stresses.
- It does not allow decomposition into physical and spurious drag contributions.
- Although often provided by the CFD solver, it is recalculated here to ensure consistent comparison with the implemented far-field methods.

### Far-field methods
Compute the aerodynamic force through integration of the net momentum flux on a control volume surrounding the body. These methods allow decomposition into physical and spurious contributions. The following formulations are implemented:
- **Paparone & Tognaccini method** ‚Üí computes the irreversible drag as a function of the non-dimensional entropy.
- **Destarac & van der Vooren method** ‚Üí computes the irreversible drag as a function of both entropy and total enthalpy.
- **Vorticity-based Lamb vector method**, where `l = œâ √ó V` ‚Üí computes both lift and drag.
- **Thermodynamic-based Lamb vector method**, where `l = T‚àás ‚àí ‚àáh + ‚àá‚ãÖœÑ/œÅ` ‚Üí computes lift and drag with reduced numerical sensitivity.

### Irreversible and parasite drag breakdown
PPUN2D supports detailed domain decomposition to isolate the sources of drag:
- **Viscous**, **shock-associated**, and **spurious** contributions can be separated.
- Decomposition is performed via:
  - *Internal sensors* based on eddy-viscosity ratio, specific dissipation rate, and pressure gradient.
  - *User-defined margins* extending each tagged region, set in the config file.
- Viscous regions are detected via high values of $(\mu + \mu_t)/\mu$ or $\omega$.
- Shock regions are flagged using pressure gradients.
- Spurious drag is computed as the residual from the total.
- All tagged regions are exported for direct visualization in Tecplot.

## üìê Gradient and Divergence Schemes

- **Green-Gauss (GG) method**:
  - Both **cell-based** and **node-based** implementations are available.
  - Gradients and divergences are allocated at cell centers.
  - Used to compute $\nabla \phi$, $\nabla \cdot \boldsymbol{\tau}$, and other key quantities.

- Volume integrals are computed via cell-wise summation.


- Surface integrals use interpolated face values and outward normal vectors.

## üóÇ Output Files

- `output.szplt`: Tecplot file containing:
- Input and computed variables (Cl, Cd, Lamb vector, region tags, etc.).
- Compatible with Tecplot 360 for visualization.

- `forces_summary.txt`: structured table including:
- Lift and drag coefficients.
- Near-field and far-field results.
- Drag-breakdown by region (viscous, shock, spurious).
- Results for all evaluated wake-plane locations.

## üîç Applications

PPUN2D is suitable for:
- Post-processing of compressible 2D steady-state RANS solutions.
- Investigating drag contributions from different flow features.
- Benchmarking Lamb vector-based and thermodynamic drag breakdown methods.
- Supporting research in unstructured mesh CFD and aerodynamic optimization.
